This directory contains generated or synced JSON artifacts.
Because they are JSON files, they do not carry inline `GENERATED / DO NOT EDIT` comments.
Treat this README as the explicit ownership header for the directory.

Shared schema files in this directory are synced from [`apppack-runtime/schemas`](/home/ubuntu/src/apppack-runtime/schemas).

Do not hand-edit:
- `declarative_decoder_runtime.schema.v1.json`
- `solana_agent_runtime.schema.v1.json`
- `solana_action_runner.schema.v1.json`

Use:
- `npm run schemas:sync`
- `npm run schemas:check`

Schema ownership rule:
- edit only [`apppack-runtime/schemas`](/home/ubuntu/src/apppack-runtime/schemas)
- never edit the copies here by hand
- if drift is reported, rerun `npm run schemas:sync`

This directory is also the current generated protocol-pack artifact source for downstream consumers.

In practice:
- authoring source lives in this repo
- generated outputs land in `public/idl/`
- downstream consumers like `apppack-view-service` should sync from these outputs instead of editing parallel copies

Protocol pack ownership rule:
- edit pack authoring source in this repo
- verify with `npm run pack:check`
- do not hand-edit generated artifacts in `public/idl/`

Generated protocol artifacts in this directory now include:
- canonical protocol specs: `*.codama.json`
- declarative indexing specs: `*.indexing.json`
- declarative runtime specs: `*.runtime.json`

Current ownership model:
- `*.codama.json` are the protocol source of truth
- `*.indexing.json` own indexed reads and discovery
- `*.runtime.json` own deterministic compute and write preparation
- downstream repos must sync these files instead of editing their own copies

Target architecture:
- `Codama` = protocol truth
- `indexing` = reads / discovery
- `runtime` = compute / write preparation / small transaction envelope

Current migration rule:
- active packs expose only `codama + runtime`
- `*.meta.json` / `*.meta.core.json` are no longer part of the active pack contract
